      <p data-i18n="about.bioText">Merja Kallunki is a professional with deep roots in Lapland, Finland. Growing up in a S√°mi family, her childhood was enriched by the traditions of reindeer herding and a profound connection to nature. This upbringing instilled in her a strong sense of presence and harmony with the natural world. Although she has spent most of her adult life in Helsinki, her heart remains in Lapland, where her journey of self-discovery and professional growth began.</p>
      <blockquote data-i18n="about.quote">‚ÄúThe conscious mind forgets, but the body remembers everything. I have embodied so many human themes and traumas in myself and my own body that there are no themes in humanity that I would not dare to look at alongside another person.‚Äù<br>‚Äì Merja Kallunki</blockquote>

      <p data-i18n="about.philosophyText">Merja‚Äôs work is deeply rooted in somatic experience, breathwork, and bodywork. She believes that unprocessed pain and trauma remain in the body, blocking the free flow of energy. Her approach integrates breath, movement, sound, touch, emotion, and meditation to support healing and self-awareness. By addressing both the physical and emotional aspects of trauma, Merja helps her clients achieve a deeper connection with themselves.</p>
