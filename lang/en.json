    "educationText": "My formal academic background includes a degree in Social Services (AMK) and a qualification as a special education teacher from the University of Helsinki. I have also studied psychology to an advanced level and attended shorter courses on supporting parenting.\n\nOver the years, I have studied extensively, so my expertise stems from several different fields, such as NLP coaching up to a master‚Äôs level, Prananadi energy healing, and deep breathing techniques.\n\nAdditionally, I am a certified Biodynamic Breathwork & Trauma Release facilitator, a program I studied in Estonia and Poland, and I have also trained in Myofascial Energetic Release bodywork at the Integral Body Institute in Poland.\n\nRecently, I have become interested in Japanese shibari bondage as a form of somatic work.\n\nIn the past year, I have had the opportunity to lead breath and bodywork training outside of Finland, including in Estonia and England."
