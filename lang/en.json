    "intro": "Breathwork By Merja Kallunki. I‚Äôm from Lapland. I went to school in Rovaniemi, but in practice, I‚Äôve spent most of my childhood in Salla. My father came from a S√°mi family, and reindeer herding was part of my childhood home. I have a strong presence and connection to nature because I‚Äôve lived in close connection with it. I‚Äôve lived in Helsinki for nearly my entire adult life, although my home is in Lapland. Experiences of the physical body have been of interest to me for a long time. Somatic experience. How and where are experiences, emotions, and traumas stored, because I believe that pain which is not allowed to be felt remains in the body, blocking the free flow of energy. Emotions are always linked to trauma, and I don‚Äôt think anyone escapes this phenomenon without traumas. It‚Äôs perhaps more about how deep they are."

    "quote": "The conscious mind forgets, but the body remembers everything. I have embodied so many human themes and traumas in myself and my own body that there are no themes in humanity that I would not dare to look at alongside another person.",

    "breathworkText": "Breath is the bridge between the physical and the spiritual. Through breath, the ratio of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body changes, and it is possible to reach non-ordinary states of consciousness. Deep breathing raises theta frequencies, allowing access to deeper states of consciousness. Breathwork can help experience relaxation, calm, and intuition. It is a powerful tool for trauma release and emotional integration.",
